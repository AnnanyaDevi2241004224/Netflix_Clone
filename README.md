# Netflix
Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand Internet streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.

As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Netflix clone using HTML and CSS. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web page.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface.
